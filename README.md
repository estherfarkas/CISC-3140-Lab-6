# CISC-3140-Lab-6
This is my work for Lab 6. 
I created a directory for the new git repository I would be using.I used init to create an empty repository. Then I copied my "Hello World" java file into the directory and used add to put the file in the repository. I used git status to see all the files involved before proceeding. I used nano to alter the file slightly and then used git commit to finish up that part. I finished the logs and moved them into a text file. For Subversion, I had a slight issue in that my machine would not allow me to add the java file to my svn repository. I wasn't sure if it was an issue with my filepath or my java file, but I'm leaning towards the path name since the file seemed fairly standard. I never realized that its possible to create repositories in terminal sing Git and SVN. This can be very helpful, especially when cloning repositories from GitHub.
